<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<ul>
    <li>This project is a simple RESTful API built using NodeJS, KOA, Typescript and TypeORM as an ORM (with MongoDB as a database). Middleware uses JWT, CORS, in-memory rate limiter, Winston Logger.</li>
    <li>Swagger API docs are used to produce the API front-end you see right now</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-to-use">How to use</h2>
<ul>
    <li>This front-end is live and the API is hosted on Heroku. Mongo Atlas free tier is used as the mongoDB database.</li>
    <li>Create a new user using <code>POST /user</code> , you can use the sample data.</li>
    <li>With the credentials you just used (email and password), log the user in via <code>POST /login</code></li>
    <li>In the response you will receive a payload with a token. Copy this token.</li>
    <li>At the top of the page, click <code>Authorize</code> and enter <code>Bearer the_token_you_copied</code> in the value box and click authorize e.g. <code>Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9</code></li>
    <li>Now you are authorized to use access the rest of the routes</li>
    <li>After about 15 min th token will expire and you can use <code>GET /refresh</code> to get a new token. The refresh token lasts for 24 hours. After that you will have to log in again.</li>
    <li>You can play around with the rest of the routes. You can also delete all created users with <code>DELETE /testusers</code> and start afresh.</li>
</ul>
